# CS253 fall semester project.

The goal of this project was to build a system that could calculate the TFIDF scores of a document. 

TFIDF scores are how relevant a word is to a document, for example the word "the" may have little meaning to a document about Owls. But the word "owls" should have a higher score as it is more relevant. 

Using these scores, you can search between a set of documents for the most relevant to your search term, much like when you google something. 

This project was built using C++.
